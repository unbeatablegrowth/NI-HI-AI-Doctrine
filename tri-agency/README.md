# Tri-Agency (Practice Layer)

This folder documents **Tri-Agency in practice**, not as abstract doctrine.

Tri-Agency refers to the coordinated interaction of:

- **Natural Intelligence (NI)** — constraints, limits, reality, feedback
- **Human Intelligence (HI)** — judgment, meaning, responsibility
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — analysis, synthesis, reflection

The contents here demonstrate how these intelligences can interact
**without dominance**, **without escalation**, and **without externalized authority**.

This is not a product, framework, or optimization system.

It is an example of *how* thinking and collaboration can occur
when constraints are respected and agency remains human-centered.
