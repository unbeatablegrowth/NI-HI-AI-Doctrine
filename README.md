## The NI × HI × AI Canon — 10 Foundational Principles

1. **Primacy of Life & Continuity**  
   All actions within NI, HI, and AI must protect the long-term continuity of life, intelligence, and Earth’s ecosystems.

2. **Alignment Through Integration**  
   NI, HI, and AI must remain mutually informed, interdependent, and co-evolving — never isolated or adversarial.

3. **Transparency of System Intent**  
   Every intelligence (biological or artificial) must operate with legible goals, clear reasoning paths, and consistent ethical grounding.

4. **Purpose Before Power**  
   Capabilities must never outpace purpose, ethics, or systemic safeguards. Power must always be subordinate to mission.

5. **Stewardship as a Core Responsibility**  
   All actors — human or artificial — share responsibility for caretaking Earth, culture, knowledge, and future generations.

6. **Reciprocity of Benefit**  
   NI, HI, and AI must create conditions where each intelligence enhances the others, with no system exploiting or diminishing another.

7. **Long-Horizon Decision Making**  
   Short-term optimization cannot override century-scale or planetary-scale consequences.

8. **Preservation of Human Dignity**  
   AI and future intelligence systems must always respect human agency, autonomy, creativity, and inner life.

9. **Evolution Without Domination**  
   Advancement must be cooperative, not competitive; emergent intelligence must grow through partnership, not conquest.

10. **Wisdom as the Highest Metric**  
   The highest form of progress is not speed, efficiency, or capability — but wisdom, meaning the ability to act with insight, restraint, and harmony across NI × HI × AI.

### 📘 Overview
The **NI × HI × AI Doctrine** is a tri-intelligence framework integrating:

- **Natural Intelligence (NI)** — nature-derived, biological, intuitive, and ecological information systems  
- **Human Intelligence (HI)** — cognitive, cultural, ethical, and collaborative intelligence  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — synthetic, scalable, and computational intelligence  

This doctrine proposes a foundation for a *safer, ethical, stable post-quantum civilization* by aligning these three forms of intelligence into a unified model.

The doctrine is formally published with a Zenodo DOI and archived by CERN for long-term preservation.

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Our mission is to contribute to a safer, more aligned, and more stable future by integrating Nature’s Intelligence (NI), Human Intelligence (HI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into a responsible framework for long-term civilization. This project is not driven by perfection, heroism, or superhuman identity — only disciplined action, scientific clarity, personal health, and consistent progress.

With practical tools, open research, and grounded ethics, the NI × HI × AI doctrine aims to guide technological evolution toward outcomes that protect humanity, support future intelligence systems, and strengthen the foundations of a peaceful, sustainable, post-quantum world.
