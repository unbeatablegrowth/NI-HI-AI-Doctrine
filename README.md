# NI × HI × AI Doctrine — Whitepaper

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17763972.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17763972)

## 📘 Overview
The **NI × HI × AI Doctrine** is a tri-intelligence framework integrating:

- **Natural Intelligence (NI)** — nature-derived, biological, intuitive, and ecological information systems  
- **Human Intelligence (HI)** — cognitive, cultural, ethical, and collaborative intelligence  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — synthetic, scalable, and computational intelligence  

This doctrine proposes a foundation for a *safer, ethical, stable post-quantum civilization* by aligning these three forms of intelligence into a unified model.

The doctrine is formally published with a Zenodo DOI and archived by CERN for long-term preservation.

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Our mission is to contribute to a safer, more aligned, and more stable future by integrating Nature’s Intelligence (NI), Human Intelligence (HI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into a responsible framework for long-term civilization. This project is not driven by perfection, heroism, or superhuman identity — only disciplined action, scientific clarity, personal health, and consistent progress.

With practical tools, open research, and grounded ethics, the NI × HI × AI doctrine aims to guide technological evolution toward outcomes that protect humanity, support future intelligence systems, and strengthen the foundations of a peaceful, sustainable, post-quantum world.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles (Draft Outline)
1. **Alignment with Nature’s Intelligence (NI)**  
2. **Preservation of Human Meaning & Agency (HI)**  
3. **Ethical Scaling of Synthetic Intelligence (AI)**  
4. **Long-term stability over short-term optimization**  
5. **Post-quantum readiness and resilience**  
6. **Open frameworks and scientific transparency**  
7. **Non-centralization of intelligence power**  

These will be expanded into a structured Canon in future releases.
